## Miscellaneous slides

<!--v-->

### Purpose of this class

"Classes about tooling are hard" especially at the beginning of the year

* "General Knowledge"
* "Pointers"
* "First experience" in manipulation

<!--s-->

### Take-away for Cloud Computing

<!--v-->

* Cloud Computing is a set of cloud providers renting infrastructure from datacenters
* They also rent more and more complex services that range from infrastructure to platform
* "Cloud computing" will be part of your job independently of your role in the data science field
* Cloud computing can offer flexibility and scalability at the cost of "price" and "security"

<!--v-->

* Virtualisation is the concept of "abstracting" and "slicing" hardware to run OSs and software on
* This was an enabler of cloud computer to divide datacenters resources according to demand
* However cloud computing led to a revolution in "usage" rather than "tech"

<!--s-->

### Take-away for Containers

<!--v-->

#### What we have learned

* Containerisation is the step beyond virtualization
* Containers are used to package software in a standardized way
* Docker Images share underlying OS & can share dependencies
* Unlike VM, you don't pre-allocate resources with containers (due to kernel sharing)
* Images are 'Classes', Containers are 'Objects'
* Docker Hubs enable collaboration

<!--v-->

#### What we haven't touched

* Containers really shine when you are deploying multi-containers applications
  *[This tutorial on microservices w/ Compose](https://training.play-with-docker.com/microservice-orchestration/)
* Containers really shine when you are in a cluster world
  *[Docker swarm](https://training.play-with-docker.com/swarm-stack-intro/)
* Orchestration & Scheduling
  *[Read this excellent Kubernetes comic !](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/kubernetes-comic/)
