Create your GCP Account \ud83d\udd17 Overview link Create an account within Google cloud Platform using your ISAE e-mail Use the code given by Dennis to get your free credits You should have 300$ + a \"free tier\" available to you From the interface you should create a project with a name of your choice 2. Install Google Cloud SDK & Configure the shell \ud83d\udd17 If you want to interact with GCP from your computer, you will need to install the Google Cloud SDK , which will also install a shell if you are on windows If you don't, you will have to do everything from google cloud shell (it's not as easy), so I recommend installing the SDK. The best ways to interact with google cloud SDK is with a terminal so in that order: Linux (either VM or native): https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#linux MacOS: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#mac Windows Subsystem for Linux: see Linux Windows: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#windows If you are on windows, you should launch the google cloud sdk shell now, Then you can configure the google cloud sdk with your account 3. My first \"VM\", Google Cloud Shell \ud83d\udd17 Intro to Google Cloud Shell \ud83d\udd17 Google Cloud Shell is a \"managed VM\" made available to interact with the GCP platform without needing to configure locally the google cloud sdk. It is useful if you only have a web browser, but it may not work and it's not as easy as using a local terminal Compared to configured a VM by yourself, this one comes loaded with developer tools and gcp authentification correctly set up, and thus is faster to use, However the main drawback to using it as a development machine is the available disk space limited to 5 Gb (not enough to build docker images for example) Here is the description of Google Cloud Shell Look at the documentation Can you describe it with your own words ? What would be the closest service that you can find on GCP that is similar to cloud shell ? Connect to google cloud shell \ud83d\udd17 Follow this guide for connecting to google cloud shell using the browser If this doesn't work on your machine for whichever reason, there is a workaround which requires having installed the google-cloud-sdk Exploring google cloud shell \ud83d\udd17 Check available disk space Bash command to run `df -h` Check the OS name Bash command to run `cat /etc/os-release` Check the CPU model Solution `cat /proc/cpuinfo` This is the hardware model... how many cores do you have available ? Which amount of RAM ? Solution `htop` will give you your current usage and available cores, or you can do `nproc` Google Cloud Shell web preview \"magic\" \ud83d\udd17 We will install Visual Studio Code Server , which is a cloud-based text editor, on Cloud Shell and preview it from your browser. There is already a code editor in Google Cloud Shell (based on Theia) but we want to showcase the web preview as well, so we will do it manually, Enable boost mode Download code-server wget https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/v3.5.0/code-server-3.5.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz What does wget do ?

Magic isn't it ? It is possible that the browser-based method does not work on your machine, there is a troubleshooting guide on this (mainly it doesn't like too much privacy on your browser) The alternative solution would be to connect to it from your terminal / local shell using the google cloud sdk, Here is the documentation for this Command to run To connect to your google cloud shell instance and enable web preview, the command to run is `gcloud alpha cloud-shell ssh -- -L 8080:localhost:8080` 4. Google Colaboratory \ud83d\udd17 Here, you will look at Google Colaboratory, which is a very handy tool for doing data science work (based on jupyter notebooks) on the cloud, using a preconfigured instance (which can access a GPU). You will be able to store data on Google Drive and to share I highly recommend using this for Jupyter based AML BE , but I invite you to discover google colab at home, or during AML BE because it's a useful tool but mastering it is not relevant for our cloud class Intro & Description of Google Colaboratory \ud83d\udd17 Open Google Colab Some intro , another one Can you describe what it is ?

Otherwise for SSHing you will be able to use the web based ssh tools and port forwarding tools of google cloud platform: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ssh-in-browser 1. My first Google Compute Engine Instance \ud83d\udd17 First, we will make our first steps by creating a compute engine instance (a vm) using the console, connecting to it via SSH, interacting with it, uploading some files, and we will shut it down and make the magic happen by resizing it What is google cloud compute engine ? try to describe it with your own words Creating my VM using the console \ud83d\udd17 Follow this codelab to create your VM Create the following instance type: n1-standard-2 zone: europe-west4-a (the netherlands) os: ubuntu 20.04 boot disk size: 10 Gb Name it however you see fit DO NOT SHUT IT DOWN for now Connecting to SSH \ud83d\udd17 Connect to ssh from google cloud shell or your terminal to the machine Solution `gcloud compute ssh {USER}@{MACHINE NAME}` Check available disk space Bash command to run `df -h` Check the OS name Bash command to run `cat /etc/os-release` Check the CPU model Solution `cat /proc/cpuinfo` Check instance google cloud properties Solution `cat /proc/cpuinfo` The magic of redimensioning VMs \ud83d\udd17 Shutdown the VM (from the web browser), check the previous codelab to see how to do it Select it and click on EDIT Change the machine type to n1-standard-4 ( link to documentation ) Relaunch it, reconnect to it and try to list the CPUs & RAM amount again Magic isn't it ? Note: If you had any files and specific configuration, they would still be here ! Transfering files from the computer to this machine \ud83d\udd17 We will use the terminal to transfer some files from * your computer to** this machine, Follow this link to learn how to use the gcloud cli tool to transfer files to your instance TOC For experts, it's possible to do it manually using rsync from ssh or scp Transfer some files to your /home/${USER} directory List them from your instance ( ls ) How do we do the opposite ? See below, 2. Interacting with Google Cloud Storage \ud83d\udd17 Here we will discover google cloud storage, upload some files from your computer and download them from your instance in the cloud What is Google Cloud Storage ? Try to describe it with your own words This codelab will guide you through the basics of google cloud storage Use this codelab something from your computer to google cloud storage from the web browser. DO NOT DELETE THE FILES YET Now we will download it using the google cloud CLI tool, Here's the documentation List the content of the bucket you just created (if you deleted it previously, create a new one) Upload a file to a bucket Download a file from a bucket What if we want to do the same from the VM ? Now go back to your machine Try to list bucket, download and upload files Is it possible ? If not, it's because you have to allow the instance to access google cloud storage Shutdown the VM and edit it (like we did when we resized the instance) Check \"access scopes\", select \"set access for each api\", and select \"storage / admin\" Now restart you machine, connect back to it. You should be able to upload to google cloud storage now files now Now you can delete the bucket you just created You can delete the VM as well, we will not use it 3. Google Compute Engine from the CLI and \"deep learning VMs\" \ud83d\udd17 Here we will use the google cloud sdk to create a more complex VM with a pre-installed image and connect to its jupyter server This will be useful for the next part of our workshop because both git and docker are already installed ! Google Cloud Platform comes with a set of services targeted at data scientists called AI Platform , among them are Deep Learning VMs which are essentially preinstalled VMs (more or less the same configuration as google colab) with some bonuses. What are \"Deep Learning VMs\" ? Try to use your own words What would be the alternative if you wanted to get a machine with the same installation ? Create a google compute engine instance with a GPU using the command line \ud83d\udd17 This is very important for the next workshop Instead of using the browser to create this machine, we will be using the CLI to create instances export INSTANCE_NAME = \"fch-dlvm-1\" # RENAME THIS !!!!!!!!!! gcloud compute instances create $INSTANCE_NAME \\ --zone = \"europe-west4-a\" \\ --image-family = \"common-cu100\" \\ --image-project = deeplearning-platform-release \\ --maintenance-policy = TERMINATE \\ --accelerator = \"type=nvidia-tesla-p100,count=1\" \\ --scopes = \"storage-rw\" \\ --machine-type = \"n1-standard-8\" \\ --boot-disk-size = 120GB \\ --metadata = \"install-nvidia-driver=True\" If you can't access GPU, remove the line regarding gpu for now, and go and request a quota increase for your project so that you will be able to access gpus later (request the corresponding GPU) In that case, change common-cu-100 for common-cpu and remove the metadata line Notice the similarities between the first VM you created and this one, What changed ? If you want to learn more about compute images, image families etc... go here Metadata command is a bit of magic provided by google to automatically install GPU drivers (very useful !) Connect to ssh to this machine and query the gpu \ud83d\udd17 Connect to your instance using the gcloud cli & ssh To query if there is a GPU recognized, you have to run nvidia-smi Shut it down, remove the gpu and restart it \ud83d\udd17 This time you have to EDIT the VM and remove the GPU instead of resizing the number of CPUs Connect back to the VM \ud83d\udd17 Relaunch the previous VM and connect to it using ssh This time, you will forward some ports as well Solution TOC {:toc} `gcloud compute ssh user@machine-name --zone europe-west4-a -- -L 8080:localhost:8080 Go to your local browser and type http://localhost:8080 , you should be in a jupyter notebook under the user jupyter You can try to play with the jupyter lab (that has a code editor and terminal capabilities) to get a feel of manipulating a remote instance Try to pip3 list to check all dependencies installed ! DO NOT DELETE THE INSTANCE FOR NOW YOU WILL NEED IT LATER 4. BONUS Introduction to infrastructure as code \ud83d\udd17 If you have finished, This tutorial will guide you through google cloud deployment manager, which is a way to deploy google compute engine instances using configuration files Don't forget to adapt machine configurations and zone to your use case (see above) 5. BONUS - Persistent sessions with TMUX \ud83d\udd17 https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/ Connect to your instance using SSH Question: What happens if you start a long computation and disconnect ? Check that tmux is installed on the remote instance (run tmux ). if not install it Follow this tutorial: https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/ To check you have understood you should be able to: Connect to your remote instance with ssh Start a tmux session Launch a process (for example top ) inside it Detach from the session ( CTRL+B :detach ) Kill the ssh connection Connect again tmux attach to your session Your process should still be here !

Manipulating docker for the 1st time \ud83d\udd17 Source: https://github.com/docker/labs To get started, let's run the following in our terminal: $ docker pull alpine The pull command fetches the alpine image from the Docker registry and saves it in our system. You can use the docker images command to see a list of all images on your system. $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED VIRTUAL SIZE alpine latest c51f86c28340 4 weeks ago 1 .109 MB hello-world latest 690ed74de00f 5 months ago 960 B 1.1 Docker Run \ud83d\udd17 Great! Let's now run a Docker container based on this image. To do that you are going to use the docker run command. $ docker run alpine ls -l total 48 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 2 16 :20 bin drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 360 Mar 18 09 :47 dev drwxr-xr-x 13 root root 4096 Mar 18 09 :47 etc drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 2 16 :20 home drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Mar 2 16 :20 lib ...... ...... What happened? Behind the scenes, a lot of stuff happened. When you call run , The Docker client contacts the Docker daemon The Docker daemon checks local store if the image (alpine in this case) is available locally, and if not, downloads it from Docker Store. (Since we have issued docker pull alpine before, the download step is not necessary) The Docker daemon creates the container and then runs a command in that container. The Docker daemon streams the output of the command to the Docker client When you run docker run alpine , you provided a command ( ls -l ), so Docker started the command specified and you saw the listing. Let's try something more exciting. $ docker run alpine echo \"hello from alpine\" hello from alpine OK, that's some actual output. In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the echo command in our alpine container and then exited it. If you've noticed, all of that happened pretty quickly. Imagine booting up a virtual machine, running a command and then killing it. Now you know why they say containers are fast! Try another command. $ docker run alpine /bin/sh Wait, nothing happened! Is that a bug? Well, no. These interactive shells will exit after running any scripted commands, unless they are run in an interactive terminal - so for this example to not exit, you need to docker run -it alpine /bin/sh . You are now inside the container shell and you can try out a few commands like ls -l , uname -a and others. Exit out of the container by giving the exit command. Ok, now it's time to see the docker ps command. The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running. $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES Since no containers are running, you see a blank line. Let's try a more useful variant: docker ps -a $ docker ps -a CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 36171a5da744 alpine \"/bin/sh\" 5 minutes ago Exited ( 0 ) 2 minutes ago fervent_newton a6a9d46d0b2f alpine \"echo 'hello from alp\" 6 minutes ago Exited ( 0 ) 6 minutes ago lonely_kilby ff0a5c3750b9 alpine \"ls -l\" 8 minutes ago Exited ( 0 ) 8 minutes ago elated_ramanujan c317d0a9e3d2 hello-world \"/hello\" 34 seconds ago Exited ( 0 ) 12 minutes ago stupefied_mcclintock What you see above is a list of all containers that you ran. Notice that the STATUS column shows that these containers exited a few minutes ago. You're probably wondering if there is a way to run more than just one command in a container. Let's try that now: $ docker run -it alpine /bin/sh / # ls bin dev etc home lib linuxrc media mnt proc root run sbin sys tmp usr var / # uname -a Linux 97916e8cb5dc 4 .4.27-moby #1 SMP Wed Oct 26 14:01:48 UTC 2016 x86_64 Linux Running the run command with the -it flags attaches us to an interactive tty in the container. Now you can run as many commands in the container as you want. Take some time to run your favorite commands. That concludes a whirlwind tour of the docker run command which would most likely be the command you'll use most often. It makes sense to spend some time getting comfortable with it. To find out more about run , use docker run --help to see a list of all flags it supports. As you proceed further, we'll see a few more variants of docker run . 1.2 Terminology \ud83d\udd17 In the last section, you saw a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before you go further, let's clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem. Images - The file system and configuration of our application which are used to create containers. To find out more about a Docker image, run docker inspect alpine . In the demo above, you used the docker pull command to download the alpine image. When you executed the command docker run hello-world , it also did a docker pull behind the scenes to download the hello-world image. Containers - Running instances of Docker images \u2014 containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers, and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS. You created a container using docker run which you did using the alpine image that you downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command. Docker daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. Docker client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon. Docker Store - A registry of Docker images, where you can find trusted and enterprise ready containers, plugins, and Docker editions. You'll be using this later in this tutorial. 2.0 Webapps with Docker \ud83d\udd17 Source: https://github.com/docker/labs Great! So you have now looked at docker run , played with a Docker container and also got the hang of some terminology. Armed with all this knowledge, you are now ready to get to the real stuff \u2014 deploying web applications with Docker. 2.1 Run a static website in a container \ud83d\udd17 Note: Code for this section is in this repo in the website directory Let's start by taking baby-steps. First, we'll use Docker to run a static website in a container. The website is based on an existing image. We'll pull a Docker image from Docker Store, run the container, and see how easy it is to set up a web server. The image that you are going to use is a single-page website that was already created for this demo and is available on the Docker Store as dockersamples/static-site . You can download and run the image directly in one go using docker run as follows. $ docker run -d dockersamples/static-site FROM nginx ENV AUTHOR = Docker WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html COPY Hello_docker.html /usr/share/nginx/html CMD cd /usr/share/nginx/html && sed -e s/Docker/ \" $AUTHOR \" / Hello_docker.html > index.html ;

The -d flag enables detached mode , which detaches the running container from the terminal/shell and returns your prompt after the container starts. We are debugging the problem with this image but for now, use -d even for this first example. So, what happens when you run this command? Since the image doesn't exist on your Docker host, the Docker daemon first fetches it from the registry and then runs it as a container. Now that the server is running, do you see the website? What port is it running on? And more importantly, how do you access the container directly from our host machine? Actually, you probably won't be able to answer any of these questions yet! \u263a In this case, the client didn't tell the Docker Engine to publish any of the ports, so you need to re-run the docker run command to add this instruction. Let's re-run the command with some new flags to publish ports and pass your name to the container to customize the message displayed. We'll use the -d option again to run the container in detached mode. First, stop the container that you have just launched. In order to do this, we need the container ID. Since we ran the container in detached mode, we don't have to launch another terminal to do this. Run docker ps to view the running containers. $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES a7a0e504ca3e dockersamples/static-site \"/bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/\" 28 seconds ago Up 26 seconds 80 /tcp, 443 /tcp stupefied_mahavira Check out the CONTAINER ID column. You will need to use this CONTAINER ID value, a long sequence of characters, to identify the container you want to stop, and then to remove it. The example below provides the CONTAINER ID on our system; you should use the value that you see in your terminal. $ docker stop a7a0e504ca3e $ docker rm a7a0e504ca3e Note: A cool feature is that you do not need to specify the entire CONTAINER ID . You can just specify a few starting characters and if it is unique among all the containers that you have launched, the Docker client will intelligently pick it up. Now, let's launch a container in detached mode as shown below: $ docker run --name static-site -e AUTHOR = \"Your Name\" -d -P dockersamples/static-site e61d12292d69556eabe2a44c16cbd54486b2527e2ce4f95438e504afb7b02810 In the above command: -d will create a container with the process detached from our terminal -P will publish all the exposed container ports to random ports on the Docker host -e is how you pass environment variables to the container --name allows you to specify a container name AUTHOR is the environment variable name and Your Name is the value that you can pass Now you can see the ports by running the docker port command. $ docker port static-site 443 /tcp -> 0 .0.0.0:32772 80 /tcp -> 0 .0.0.0:32773 If you are running Docker for Mac , Docker for Windows , or Docker on Linux, you can open http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT_FOR 80/tcp] . For our example this is http://localhost:32773 . If you are using Docker Machine on Mac or Windows, you can find the hostname on the command line using docker-machine as follows (assuming you are using the default machine). $ docker-machine ip default 192 .168.99.100 You can now open http://<YOUR_IPADDRESS>:[YOUR_PORT_FOR 80/tcp] to see your site live! For our example, this is: http://192.168.99.100:32773 . You can also run a second webserver at the same time, specifying a custom host port mapping to the container's webserver. $ docker run --name static-site-2 -e AUTHOR = \"Your Name\" -d -p 8888 :80 dockersamples/static-site To deploy this on a real server you would just need to install Docker, and run the above docker command(as in this case you can see the AUTHOR is Docker which we passed as an environment variable). Now that you've seen how to run a webserver inside a Docker container, how do you create your own Docker image? This is the question we'll explore in the next section. But first, let's stop and remove the containers since you won't be using them anymore. $ docker stop static-site $ docker rm static-site Let's use a shortcut to remove the second site: $ docker rm -f static-site-2 Run docker ps to make sure the containers are gone. $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 2.2 Docker Images \ud83d\udd17 In this section, let's dive deeper into what Docker images are. You will build your own image, use that image to run an application locally. Docker images are the basis of containers. In the previous example, you pulled the dockersamples/static-site image from the registry and asked the Docker client to run a container based on that image. To see the list of images that are available locally on your system, run the docker images command. $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dockersamples/static-site latest 92a386b6e686 2 hours ago 190 .5 MB nginx latest af4b3d7d5401 3 hours ago 190 .5 MB python 2 .7 1c32174fd534 14 hours ago 676 .8 MB postgres 9 .4 88d845ac7a88 14 hours ago 263 .6 MB containous/traefik latest 27b4e0c6b2fd 4 days ago 20 .75 MB node 0 .10 42426a5cba5f 6 days ago 633 .7 MB redis latest 4f5f397d4b7c 7 days ago 177 .5 MB mongo latest 467eb21035a8 7 days ago 309 .7 MB alpine 3 .3 70c557e50ed6 8 days ago 4 .794 MB java 7 21f6ce84e43c 8 days ago 587 .7 MB Above is a list of images that I've pulled from the registry and those I've created myself (we'll shortly see how). You will have a different list of images on your machine. The TAG refers to a particular snapshot of the image and the ID is the corresponding unique identifier for that image. For simplicity, you can think of an image akin to a git repository - images can be committed with changes and have multiple versions. When you do not provide a specific version number, the client defaults to latest . For example you could pull a specific version of ubuntu image as follows: $ docker pull ubuntu:12.04 If you do not specify the version number of the image then, as mentioned, the Docker client will default to a version named latest . So for example, the docker pull command given below will pull an image named ubuntu:latest : $ docker pull ubuntu To get a new Docker image you can either get it from a registry (such as the Docker Store) or create your own. There are hundreds of thousands of images available on Docker Store . You can also search for images directly from the command line using docker search . An important distinction with regard to images is between base images and child images . Base images are images that have no parent images, usually images with an OS like ubuntu, alpine or debian. Child images are images that build on base images and add additional functionality. Another key concept is the idea of official images and user images . (Both of which can be base images or child images.) Official images are Docker sanctioned images. Docker, Inc. sponsors a dedicated team that is responsible for reviewing and publishing all Official Repositories content. This team works in collaboration with upstream software maintainers, security experts, and the broader Docker community. These are not prefixed by an organization or user name. In the list of images above, the python , node , alpine and nginx images are official (base) images. To find out more about them, check out the Official Images Documentation . User images are images created and shared by users like you. They build on base images and add additional functionality. Typically these are formatted as user/image-name . The user value in the image name is your Docker Store user or organization name. 2.3 Create your first image \ud83d\udd17 Note: The code for this section is in this repository in the flask-app directory. Now that you have a better understanding of images, it's time to create your own. Our goal here is to create an image that sandboxes a small Flask application. The goal of this exercise is to create a Docker image which will run a Flask app. We'll do this by first pulling together the components for a random cat picture generator built with Python Flask, then dockerizing it by writing a Dockerfile . Finally, we'll build the image, and then run it. Create a Python Flask app that displays random cat pix Write a Dockerfile Build the image Run your image Dockerfile commands summary 2.3.1 Create a Python Flask app that displays random cat pix \ud83d\udd17 For the purposes of this workshop, we've created a fun little Python Flask app that displays a random cat .gif every time it is loaded - because, you know, who doesn't like cats? Start by creating a directory called flask-app where we'll create the following files: app.py requirements.txt templates/index.html Dockerfile Make sure to cd flask-app before you start creating the files, because you don't want to start adding a whole bunch of other random files to your image. app.py \ud83d\udd17 Create the app.py with the following content: from flask import Flask , render_template import random app = Flask ( __name__ ) # list of cat images images = [ \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr05/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-26388-1381844103-11.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr01/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-31540-1381844535-8.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr05/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-26390-1381844163-18.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr06/15/10/anigif_enhanced-buzz-1376-1381846217-0.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr03/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-3391-1381844336-26.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr06/15/10/anigif_enhanced-buzz-29111-1381845968-0.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr03/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-3409-1381844582-13.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr02/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-19667-1381844937-10.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr05/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-26358-1381845043-13.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr06/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-18774-1381844645-6.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr06/15/9/anigif_enhanced-buzz-25158-1381844793-0.gif\" , \"http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr03/15/10/anigif_enhanced-buzz-11980-1381846269-1.gif\" ] @app . route ( '/' ) def index (): url = random . choice ( images ) return render_template ( 'index.html' , url = url ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : app . run ( host = \"0.0.0.0\" ) requirements.txt \ud83d\udd17 In order to install the Python modules required for our app, we need to create a file called requirements.txt and add the following line to that file: Flask==0.10.1 templates/index.html \ud83d\udd17 Create a directory called templates and create an index.html file in that directory with the following content in it: < html > < head > < style type = \"text/css\" > body { background : black ; color : white ; } div . container { max-width : 500 px ; margin : 100 px auto ; border : 20 px solid white ; padding : 10 px ; text-align : center ; } h4 { text-transform : uppercase ; } </ style > </ head > < body > < div class = \"container\" > < h4 > Cat Gif of the day </ h4 > < img src = \"{{url}}\" /> < p >< small > Courtesy: < a href = \"http://www.buzzfeed.com/copyranter/the-best-cat-gif-post-in-the-history-of-cat-gifs\" > Buzzfeed </ a ></ small ></ p > </ div > </ body > </ html > 2.3.2 Write a Dockerfile \ud83d\udd17 We want to create a Docker image with this web app. As mentioned above, all user images are based on a base image . Since our application is written in Python, we will build our own Python image based on Alpine . We'll do that using a Dockerfile . A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker daemon calls while creating an image. The Dockerfile contains all the information that Docker needs to know to run the app \u2014 a base Docker image to run from, location of your project code, any dependencies it has, and what commands to run at start-up. It is a simple way to automate the image creation process. The best part is that the commands you write in a Dockerfile are almost identical to their equivalent Linux commands. This means you don't really have to learn new syntax to create your own Dockerfiles. Create a file called Dockerfile , and add content to it as described below. We'll start by specifying our base image, using the FROM keyword: FROM alpine:3.5 The next step usually is to write the commands of copying the files and installing the dependencies. But first we will install the Python pip package to the alpine linux distribution. This will not just install the pip package but any other dependencies too, which includes the python interpreter. Add the following RUN command next: RUN apk add --update py2-pip Let's add the files that make up the Flask Application. Install all Python requirements for our app to run. This will be accomplished by adding the lines: COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/ RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt Copy the files you have created earlier into our image by using COPY command. COPY app.py /usr/src/app/ COPY templates/index.html /usr/src/app/templates/ Specify the port number which needs to be exposed. Since our flask app is running on 5000 that's what we'll expose. EXPOSE 5000 The last step is the command for running the application which is simply - python ./app.py . Use the CMD command to do that: CMD [\"python\", \"/usr/src/app/app.py\"] The primary purpose of CMD is to tell the container which command it should run by default when it is started. Verify your Dockerfile. Our Dockerfile is now ready. This is how it looks: ``` # our base image FROM alpine:3.5 # Install python and pip RUN apk add --update py2-pip # install Python modules needed by the Python app COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/ RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt # copy files required for the app to run COPY app.py /usr/src/app/ COPY templates/index.html /usr/src/app/templates/ # tell the port number the container should expose EXPOSE 5000 # run the application CMD [\"python\", \"/usr/src/app/app.py\"] ``` 2.3.3 Build the image \ud83d\udd17 Now that you have your Dockerfile , you can build your image. The docker build command does the heavy-lifting of creating a docker image from a Dockerfile . The docker build command is quite simple - it takes an optional tag name with the -t flag, and the location of the directory containing the Dockerfile - the . indicates the current directory: docker build -t myfirstapp:1.0 $ docker build - t myfirstapp : 1.0 .

Therefore, your output on running the command will look different from mine. If everything went well, your image should be ready! Run docker images and see if your image ( <YOUR_USERNAME>/myfirstapp ) shows. 2.3.4 Run your image \ud83d\udd17 The next step in this section is to run the image and see if it actually works. $ docker run -p 8888 :5000 --name myfirstapp myfirstapp:1.0 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ ( Press CTRL+C to quit ) Head over to http://localhost:8888 and your app should be live. Note If you are using Docker Machine, you may need to open up another terminal and determine the container ip address using docker-machine ip default . Hit the Refresh button in the web browser to see a few more cat images. 2.3.5 Dockerfile commands summary \ud83d\udd17 Here's a quick summary of the few basic commands we used in our Dockerfile. FROM starts the Dockerfile. It is a requirement that the Dockerfile must start with the FROM command. Images are created in layers, which means you can use another image as the base image for your own. The FROM command defines your base layer. As arguments, it takes the name of the image. Optionally, you can add the Docker Cloud username of the maintainer and image version, in the format username/imagename:version . RUN is used to build up the Image you're creating. For each RUN command, Docker will run the command then create a new layer of the image. This way you can roll back your image to previous states easily. The syntax for a RUN instruction is to place the full text of the shell command after the RUN (e.g., RUN mkdir /user/local/foo ). This will automatically run in a /bin/sh shell. You can define a different shell like this: RUN /bin/bash -c 'mkdir /user/local/foo' COPY copies local files into the container. CMD defines the commands that will run on the Image at start-up. Unlike a RUN , this does not create a new layer for the Image, but simply runs the command. There can only be one CMD per a Dockerfile/Image. If you need to run multiple commands, the best way to do that is to have the CMD run a script. CMD requires that you tell it where to run the command, unlike RUN . So example CMD commands would be: CMD [ \"python\" , \"./app.py\" ] CMD [ \"/bin/bash\" , \"echo\" , \"Hello World\" ] EXPOSE creates a hint for users of an image which ports provide services. It is included in the information which can be retrieved via $ docker inspect <container-id> . Note: The EXPOSE command does not actually make any ports accessible to the host! Instead, this requires publishing ports by means of the -p flag when using $ docker run . PUSH pushes your image to Docker Cloud, or alternately to a private registry Note: If you want to learn more about Dockerfiles, check out Best practices for writing Dockerfiles . 3. Containers Registry \ud83d\udd17 Remember Container Registries ? Here as some explainers The main container registry is dockerhub, https://hub.docker.com/ All docker engines that have access to the internet have access to this main hub, and this is where we pulled our base images from before Example, the Python Image Google Cloud has a Container Registry per project, which ensures the docker images you build are accessible for the people who have access to your project only. However, it requires naming the image in a specific fashion: eu.gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/name:tag Use the docker cli to tag your previous myfirstapp image to the right namespace docker tag myfirstapp eu.gcr.io/{PROJECT_ID}/myfirstapp:1.0 Upload it on container registry docker push [HOSTNAME]/[PROJECT-ID]/[IMAGE]:[TAG] If you have a problem of authentification, gcloud auth configure-docker Helping: to get your project id: PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project 2> /dev/null) Go to container registry https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr, you should see your docker image :) 4. Data Science Standardized Environment \ud83d\udd17 Intro \ud83d\udd17 Those of us who work on a team know how hard it is to create a standardize development environment. Or if you have ever updated a dependency and had everything break, you understand the importance of keeping development environments isolated. Using Docker, we can create a project / team image with our development environment and mount a volume with our notebooks and data. The benefits of this workflow are that we can: Separate out projects Spin up a container to onboard new employees Build an automated testing pipeline to confirm upgrade dependencies do not break code Kaggle Docker Image \ud83d\udd17 For this exercise we will use Kaggle Docker Image which is a fully configured docker image that can be used as a data science container Take a look at the documentation and the repository Get the algorithm in ML git in your Virtual Machine \ud83d\udd17 From your vm, run git clone https://github.com/erachelson/MLclass.git , this should setup your AML class inside your VM Using code-server is not mandatory now Mounting volumes and ports \ud83d\udd17 Now let's run the image. This container has a jupyter notebook accessible from port 8080 so we will need to map the host port 8888 (the one accessible from the ssh tunnel) to the docker port 8080, we will use port forwarding We will also need to make available the notebooks on the VM to the container... we will mount volumes . Your data is located in /home/${USER}/MLClass and we want to miunt it in /tmp/workdir docker run --rm -it \\ -p 8888 :8080 \\ -v /home/ ${ USER } /MLclass:/home/Mlclass \\ --workdir /home/ \\ gcr.io/kaggle-images/python \\ /bin/bash /run_jupyter.sh Note: this image is very large ! Options breakdown: - --rm remove the container when we stop it - -it run the container in interactive mode - -p forward port from host:container - other: options from the kaggle container You should now see a jupyter lab with mlclass accessible if you connect your browser (in your laptop) to port 8888 (localhost:8888) So basically, we mapped the ports local 8888 to vm 8888 and vm 8888 to docker 8080 5. Bonus - Using Google Cloud Tools for Docker \ud83d\udd17 Using cloud shell you should be able to do the Hello World Dockerfile exercise except that instead of using docker build you use Google Cloud Build Tutorial: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-docker Example command : gcloud builds submit --tag eu.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/{image}:{tag} . Helping: to get your project id: PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project 2> /dev/null) Try to build the hello world app 6.

What happened? Behind the scenes, a lot of stuff happened. When you call run , The Docker client contacts the Docker daemon The Docker daemon checks local store if the image (alpine in this case) is available locally, and if not, downloads it from Docker Store. (Since we have issued docker pull alpine before, the download step is not necessary) The Docker daemon creates the container and then runs a command in that container. The Docker daemon streams the output of the command to the Docker client When you run docker run alpine , you provided a command ( ls -l ), so Docker started the command specified and you saw the listing. Let's try something more exciting. $ docker run alpine echo \"hello from alpine\" hello from alpine OK, that's some actual output. In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the echo command in our alpine container and then exited it. If you've noticed, all of that happened pretty quickly. Imagine booting up a virtual machine, running a command and then killing it. Now you know why they say containers are fast! Try another command. $ docker run alpine /bin/sh Wait, nothing happened! Is that a bug? Well, no. These interactive shells will exit after running any scripted commands, unless they are run in an interactive terminal - so for this example to not exit, you need to docker run -it alpine /bin/sh . You are now inside the container shell and you can try out a few commands like ls -l , uname -a and others. Exit out of the container by giving the exit command. Ok, now it's time to see the docker ps command. The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running. $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES Since no containers are running, you see a blank line. Let's try a more useful variant: docker ps -a $ docker ps -a CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 36171a5da744 alpine \"/bin/sh\" 5 minutes ago Exited ( 0 ) 2 minutes ago fervent_newton a6a9d46d0b2f alpine \"echo 'hello from alp\" 6 minutes ago Exited ( 0 ) 6 minutes ago lonely_kilby ff0a5c3750b9 alpine \"ls -l\" 8 minutes ago Exited ( 0 ) 8 minutes ago elated_ramanujan c317d0a9e3d2 hello-world \"/hello\" 34 seconds ago Exited ( 0 ) 12 minutes ago stupefied_mcclintock What you see above is a list of all containers that you ran. Notice that the STATUS column shows that these containers exited a few minutes ago. You're probably wondering if there is a way to run more than just one command in a container. Let's try that now: $ docker run -it alpine /bin/sh / # ls bin dev etc home lib linuxrc media mnt proc root run sbin sys tmp usr var / # uname -a Linux 97916e8cb5dc 4 .4.27-moby #1 SMP Wed Oct 26 14:01:48 UTC 2016 x86_64 Linux Running the run command with the -it flags attaches us to an interactive tty in the container. Now you can run as many commands in the container as you want. Take some time to run your favorite commands. That concludes a whirlwind tour of the docker run command which would most likely be the command you'll use most often. It makes sense to spend some time getting comfortable with it. To find out more about run , use docker run --help to see a list of all flags it supports. As you proceed further, we'll see a few more variants of docker run .","title":"1.1 Docker Run"},{"location":"exercises/3_docker/#12-terminology","text":"In the last section, you saw a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before you go further, let's clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem. Images - The file system and configuration of our application which are used to create containers. To find out more about a Docker image, run docker inspect alpine . In the demo above, you used the docker pull command to download the alpine image. When you executed the command docker run hello-world , it also did a docker pull behind the scenes to download the hello-world image. Containers - Running instances of Docker images \u2014 containers run the actual applications. A container includes an application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers, and runs as an isolated process in user space on the host OS. You created a container using docker run which you did using the alpine image that you downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command. Docker daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. Docker client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon. Docker Store - A registry of Docker images, where you can find trusted and enterprise ready containers, plugins, and Docker editions.

The -d flag enables detached mode , which detaches the running container from the terminal/shell and returns your prompt after the container starts. We are debugging the problem with this image but for now, use -d even for this first example. So, what happens when you run this command? Since the image doesn't exist on your Docker host, the Docker daemon first fetches it from the registry and then runs it as a container. Now that the server is running, do you see the website? What port is it running on? And more importantly, how do you access the container directly from our host machine? Actually, you probably won't be able to answer any of these questions yet! \u263a In this case, the client didn't tell the Docker Engine to publish any of the ports, so you need to re-run the docker run command to add this instruction. Let's re-run the command with some new flags to publish ports and pass your name to the container to customize the message displayed. We'll use the -d option again to run the container in detached mode. First, stop the container that you have just launched. In order to do this, we need the container ID. Since we ran the container in detached mode, we don't have to launch another terminal to do this. Run docker ps to view the running containers. $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES a7a0e504ca3e dockersamples/static-site \"/bin/sh -c 'cd /usr/\" 28 seconds ago Up 26 seconds 80 /tcp, 443 /tcp stupefied_mahavira Check out the CONTAINER ID column. You will need to use this CONTAINER ID value, a long sequence of characters, to identify the container you want to stop, and then to remove it. The example below provides the CONTAINER ID on our system; you should use the value that you see in your terminal. $ docker stop a7a0e504ca3e $ docker rm a7a0e504ca3e Note: A cool feature is that you do not need to specify the entire CONTAINER ID . You can just specify a few starting characters and if it is unique among all the containers that you have launched, the Docker client will intelligently pick it up. Now, let's launch a container in detached mode as shown below: $ docker run --name static-site -e AUTHOR = \"Your Name\" -d -P dockersamples/static-site e61d12292d69556eabe2a44c16cbd54486b2527e2ce4f95438e504afb7b02810 In the above command: -d will create a container with the process detached from our terminal -P will publish all the exposed container ports to random ports on the Docker host -e is how you pass environment variables to the container --name allows you to specify a container name AUTHOR is the environment variable name and Your Name is the value that you can pass Now you can see the ports by running the docker port command. $ docker port static-site 443 /tcp -> 0 .0.0.0:32772 80 /tcp -> 0 .0.0.0:32773 If you are running Docker for Mac , Docker for Windows , or Docker on Linux, you can open http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT_FOR 80/tcp] . For our example this is http://localhost:32773 . If you are using Docker Machine on Mac or Windows, you can find the hostname on the command line using docker-machine as follows (assuming you are using the default machine). $ docker-machine ip default 192 .168.99.100 You can now open http://<YOUR_IPADDRESS>:[YOUR_PORT_FOR 80/tcp] to see your site live! For our example, this is: http://192.168.99.100:32773 . You can also run a second webserver at the same time, specifying a custom host port mapping to the container's webserver. $ docker run --name static-site-2 -e AUTHOR = \"Your Name\" -d -p 8888 :80 dockersamples/static-site To deploy this on a real server you would just need to install Docker, and run the above docker command(as in this case you can see the AUTHOR is Docker which we passed as an environment variable). Now that you've seen how to run a webserver inside a Docker container, how do you create your own Docker image? This is the question we'll explore in the next section. But first, let's stop and remove the containers since you won't be using them anymore. $ docker stop static-site $ docker rm static-site Let's use a shortcut to remove the second site: $ docker rm -f static-site-2 Run docker ps to make sure the containers are gone. $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES","title":"2.1 Run a static website in a container"},{"location":"exercises/3_docker/#22-docker-images","text":"In this section, let's dive deeper into what Docker images are. You will build your own image, use that image to run an application locally. Docker images are the basis of containers. In the previous example, you pulled the dockersamples/static-site image from the registry and asked the Docker client to run a container based on that image. To see the list of images that are available locally on your system, run the docker images command. $ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE dockersamples/static-site latest 92a386b6e686 2 hours ago 190 .5 MB nginx latest af4b3d7d5401 3 hours ago 190 .5 MB python 2 .7 1c32174fd534 14 hours ago 676 .8 MB postgres 9 .4 88d845ac7a88 14 hours ago 263 .6 MB containous/traefik latest 27b4e0c6b2fd 4 days ago 20 .75 MB node 0 .10 42426a5cba5f 6 days ago 633 .7 MB redis latest 4f5f397d4b7c 7 days ago 177 .5 MB mongo latest 467eb21035a8 7 days ago 309 .7 MB alpine 3 .3 70c557e50ed6 8 days ago 4 .794 MB java 7 21f6ce84e43c 8 days ago 587 .7 MB Above is a list of images that I've pulled from the registry and those I've created myself (we'll shortly see how). You will have a different list of images on your machine. The TAG refers to a particular snapshot of the image and the ID is the corresponding unique identifier for that image. For simplicity, you can think of an image akin to a git repository - images can be committed with changes and have multiple versions. When you do not provide a specific version number, the client defaults to latest . For example you could pull a specific version of ubuntu image as follows: $ docker pull ubuntu:12.04 If you do not specify the version number of the image then, as mentioned, the Docker client will default to a version named latest . So for example, the docker pull command given below will pull an image named ubuntu:latest : $ docker pull ubuntu To get a new Docker image you can either get it from a registry (such as the Docker Store) or create your own. There are hundreds of thousands of images available on Docker Store . You can also search for images directly from the command line using docker search . An important distinction with regard to images is between base images and child images . Base images are images that have no parent images, usually images with an OS like ubuntu, alpine or debian. Child images are images that build on base images and add additional functionality. Another key concept is the idea of official images and user images . (Both of which can be base images or child images.) Official images are Docker sanctioned images. Docker, Inc. sponsors a dedicated team that is responsible for reviewing and publishing all Official Repositories content. This team works in collaboration with upstream software maintainers, security experts, and the broader Docker community. These are not prefixed by an organization or user name. In the list of images above, the python , node , alpine and nginx images are official (base) images. To find out more about them, check out the Official Images Documentation . User images are images created and shared by users like you. They build on base images and add additional functionality. Typically these are formatted as user/image-name . The user value in the image name is your Docker Store user or organization name.","title":"2.2 Docker Images"},{"location":"exercises/3_docker/#23-create-your-first-image","text":"Note: The code for this section is in this repository in the flask-app directory.

Since our application is written in Python, we will build our own Python image based on Alpine . We'll do that using a Dockerfile . A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker daemon calls while creating an image. The Dockerfile contains all the information that Docker needs to know to run the app \u2014 a base Docker image to run from, location of your project code, any dependencies it has, and what commands to run at start-up. It is a simple way to automate the image creation process. The best part is that the commands you write in a Dockerfile are almost identical to their equivalent Linux commands. This means you don't really have to learn new syntax to create your own Dockerfiles. Create a file called Dockerfile , and add content to it as described below. We'll start by specifying our base image, using the FROM keyword: FROM alpine:3.5 The next step usually is to write the commands of copying the files and installing the dependencies. But first we will install the Python pip package to the alpine linux distribution. This will not just install the pip package but any other dependencies too, which includes the python interpreter. Add the following RUN command next: RUN apk add --update py2-pip Let's add the files that make up the Flask Application. Install all Python requirements for our app to run. This will be accomplished by adding the lines: COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/ RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt Copy the files you have created earlier into our image by using COPY command. COPY app.py /usr/src/app/ COPY templates/index.html /usr/src/app/templates/ Specify the port number which needs to be exposed. Since our flask app is running on 5000 that's what we'll expose. EXPOSE 5000 The last step is the command for running the application which is simply - python ./app.py . Use the CMD command to do that: CMD [\"python\", \"/usr/src/app/app.py\"] The primary purpose of CMD is to tell the container which command it should run by default when it is started. Verify your Dockerfile. Our Dockerfile is now ready. This is how it looks: ``` # our base image FROM alpine:3.5 # Install python and pip RUN apk add --update py2-pip # install Python modules needed by the Python app COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/ RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt # copy files required for the app to run COPY app.py /usr/src/app/ COPY templates/index.html /usr/src/app/templates/ # tell the port number the container should expose EXPOSE 5000 # run the application CMD [\"python\", \"/usr/src/app/app.py\"] ```","title":"2.3.2 Write a Dockerfile"},{"location":"exercises/3_docker/#233-build-the-image","text":"Now that you have your Dockerfile , you can build your image.

FROM starts the Dockerfile. It is a requirement that the Dockerfile must start with the FROM command. Images are created in layers, which means you can use another image as the base image for your own. The FROM command defines your base layer. As arguments, it takes the name of the image. Optionally, you can add the Docker Cloud username of the maintainer and image version, in the format username/imagename:version . RUN is used to build up the Image you're creating. For each RUN command, Docker will run the command then create a new layer of the image. This way you can roll back your image to previous states easily. The syntax for a RUN instruction is to place the full text of the shell command after the RUN (e.g., RUN mkdir /user/local/foo ). This will automatically run in a /bin/sh shell. You can define a different shell like this: RUN /bin/bash -c 'mkdir /user/local/foo' COPY copies local files into the container. CMD defines the commands that will run on the Image at start-up. Unlike a RUN , this does not create a new layer for the Image, but simply runs the command. There can only be one CMD per a Dockerfile/Image. If you need to run multiple commands, the best way to do that is to have the CMD run a script. CMD requires that you tell it where to run the command, unlike RUN . So example CMD commands would be: CMD [ \"python\" , \"./app.py\" ] CMD [ \"/bin/bash\" , \"echo\" , \"Hello World\" ] EXPOSE creates a hint for users of an image which ports provide services. It is included in the information which can be retrieved via $ docker inspect <container-id> . Note: The EXPOSE command does not actually make any ports accessible to the host! Instead, this requires publishing ports by means of the -p flag when using $ docker run .
