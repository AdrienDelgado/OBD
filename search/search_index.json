The extraction of useful knowledge from data has long been one of the grand challenges of computer science, and the dawn of \"big data\" has transformed the landscape of data storage, manipulation, and analysis. In this module, we will look at the tools used to store and interact with data. The objective of this class is that students gain: First hand experience with and detailed knowledge of computing models, notably cloud computing An understanding of distributed programming models and data distribution Broad knowledge of many databases and their respective strengths As a part of the Data and Decision Sciences Master's program, this module aims specifically at providing the tool set students will use for data analysis and knowledge extraction using skills acquired in the Algorithms of Machine Learning and Digital Economy and Data Uses classes. Class structure \ud83d\udd17 The class is structured in three parts: Data computation \ud83d\udd17 20 hours on the computing platforms used in the data ecosystem. We will briefly cover cluster computing and then go in depth on cloud computing, using Google Cloud Platform as an example. Finally, a class on GPU computing will be given in coordination with the deep learning section of the AML class. Data distribution \ud83d\udd17 20 hours on the distribution of data, with a focus on distributed programming models. We will introduce functional programming and MapReduce, then use these concepts in a practical session on Spark. Finally, students will do a graded exercise with Dask. Databases \ud83d\udd17 In the final 10 hours of the course, state-of-the-art databases will be presented. Students will install and demonstrate the advantages of different databases to their peers as a graded project. Class schedule \ud83d\udd17 Class dates are subject to change.
